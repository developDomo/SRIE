Other measures use different definitions, with varying empirically- and conceptually-driven perspectives on how best to define ‘on track’. Methodological work is ongoing to define commonly agreed terms and methods for more comprehensively assessing each of the domains of early childhood development (i.e. health, learning and psychosocial well-being).</p>",

Children are developmentally on-track physically if they can pick up small objects easily and are generally well enough to play. Children are developmentally on-track in socio-emotional development if at least two of the following are true: they get along with other children; do not usually kick, bite or hit other children; and they are not easily distracted. Children are developmentally on-track in learning if they can follow simple instructions correctly on how to do something and/or when given something to do, and they are able to do it independently.</p>"

Aggregate data often combine data for different levels of attainment, for example by combining the percentage of the population with incomplete or complete primary education in a single figure instead of reporting the data for each level of attainment separately. If data for levels n and n+1 are combined, it is only possible to calculate the percentage of the population who completed at least level n, but not the percentage of the population who completed level n+1. Data on the highest qualification obtained are not very common, partly because the multitude of qualifications that may be obtained in a country and abroad makes data collection difficult."
